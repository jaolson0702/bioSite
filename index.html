        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Jennifer Olson was born and raised in California, but lives in
          Wisconsin now. She enjoys doing many things with her family, including
          watch movies and cook meals. In her free time, she looks for deals
          online to help save money for the family. She likes to keep in touch
          with other family members, communicating with them through letters and
          by other means. While growing up, she applied her own skills and the
          lessons learned from her role models to gain experience in many
          fields, and she was recognized for these accomplishments. She
          continues to make a difference in the lives of her family and friends
          today.
