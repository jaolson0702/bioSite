      <h2>While Growing Up...</h2>
      <div class="hobby">
        <h3>Singing/Dancing</h3>
        <p>
          Jennifer grew up with a passion for singing and dancing. She did this
          with the campfire girls, and she also enjoyed doing it with other
          friends and family. Jennifer also participated in other music-related
          activities, such as playing the piano, sometimes in duets with her
          mother and sister. Her singing experiences included concerts with the
          Little Ambassadors of Shanghai and a concert for the Centennial
          Celebration in Pasadena. She also enjoys listening to energetic music
          while exercising, especially Abba.

        <h3>Attending Camps</h3>
        <p>
          Jennifer had many new experiences when attending camps throughout her
          schooling, including canoeing. She was willing to help the others out
          with their tasks, giving her the experience of pursuing a goal, trying
          new things, and not giving up. An example of this is what she helped
          portage a canoe, which had 240 rods in it. While attending school, she
          went to Ore, Minnesota as a camper. During the second session there,
          she worked in the office. The night after her high school graduation,
          she left for Ore, Minnesota again.

        <h3>Cooking</h3>

          <img src="images/cooking.png" />
          <p>
            Jennifer enjoys cooking for her family, especially when visiting
            extended family members. She frequently cooks chocolate-chip bars,
            chocolate-chip blondies, and other tasty treats. She especially
            likes to do it in cooler weather. She uses her attention to detail
            to make these recipes the way she and her family like it.

        <h3>Exercising</h3>
        <div id="exercising_content">
          <p>
            Jennifer walks and lifts weights frequently throughout the day. Her
            goal is to stay in shape and improve her health. She applies the
            principle that she knows that she can hit her goal if she keeps at
            it. This involves perseverance and stepping out of her comfort zone
            from time to time.

          <p>
            Jennifer goes on her computer every day to find ways to save money
            for her family. She does this by doing surveys to get rewards,
            entering sweepstakes, and clipping coupons. She uses her speed,
            memory, and attention to detail to help her with this, and she is
            also a fast typist.
