        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
          Jennifer Olson was born in southern California and raised in Altadena.
          She has three siblings, one of which is an older sister. She enjoyed
          singing and dancing with her family as she grew up, especially for a
          group called the campfire girls. They would host craft shows and
          concerts, which were partially funded by a local pizza place. Her
          childhood centered on spending time with her family and friends,
          especially when it came to singing activities and playing outside in
          the family pool.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout her schooling, Jennifer attended various camps, including
          one in Ore, Minnesota. She applied the incentive of neer giving up
          when doing various activities, which resulted in her learning new
          things from these experiences. Jennifer attended private schools in
          Pasadena, graduating from Imperial Schools with a class of 36
          students. While a student there, she had the privilege of singing in
          concerts with the Little Ambassadors of Shanghai, who had come over
          from China, sponsored by the Ambassador Foundation. They were able to
          perform in Pasadena, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. in the
          Kennedy Center.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jennifer worked her way through high school and college. When she was
          seventeen and eighteen years old, she taught gymnastics with her older
          sister. For a while, she was also the secretary of the Architecture
          and Engineering section of the church organization she and her family
          attended. She worked in the kitchen of the Ambassador College campus,
          during which time one of her pastimes was playing volleyball. This
          ended, however, when she suffered a knee injury in her freshman year
          of college. One of her teachers gave her housing for about a week so
          she could recover from this injury, and began working at the dining
          room console, calling and paging people in the area. In her senior
          year, she had to resume working in the kitchen due to students getting
          loans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, Jennifer was hired at a home loans company in the area,
          where she worked as a floater. Basically, this meant assisting other
          employees with jobs as they needed help. After she graduated from
          college, this job became full-time, and she was trained more fully on
          how to endorse and deposit checks. After her department was
          consolidated into the real estate management department of the home
          loans company, she became certified as a team leader in the property
          claims department.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2001, she and her husband decided to move to Wisconsin, so she quit
          her job at the home loans company. Though she never again held a
          full-time job, she focused on finding ways to save money for her
          family, including entering surveys and sweepstakes.
